# OpenFFBoard-hardware
This contains the hardware designs of the OpenFFBoard

These are work in progress.
No guarantee for functionality or safety! The designs are NOT FINALLY TESTED.
The firmware is available in the main [OpenFFBoard](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard) git.

This project requires soldering of many fine pitched parts.

Full Kits will be available later once everything is tested. Check the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gHtnEcP) and [project page](https://hackaday.io/project/163904-open-ffboard) for updates.
